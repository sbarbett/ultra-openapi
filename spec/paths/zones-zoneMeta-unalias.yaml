  summary: Unalias a Zone
  description: |
    Unaliasing a zone is the process of converting an Alias Zone into a Primary Zone. When you unalias a zone, the following changes happen:
    
    - All of the data and zone configuration information is copied from the Primary to the Alias.
    - The Alias is converted into a Primary zone.
    - Any correlation between the original Primary and new Primary (formerly the Alias) is removed; the two are now wholly separate Primary zones.
