  summary: Suspend a Zone
  description: |
    Suspending a zone allows you to temporarily stop serving data for a zone without deleting that zone. When you suspend a zone, the following changes happen:
    
    - The zone cannot be updated via a PUT or PATCH
    - Performing a GET will still return zone data
  operationId: suspendZone
  parameters:
    - $ref: '../components/parameters/ZoneName.yaml'
  requestBody:
    required: false
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            changeComment:
              type: string
              description: An optional field allowing users to create a comment for a zone operation using up to 512 characters of free text, which can be viewed and searched for via the Audit Log Report. Not applicable for Batch or JSON Patch calls.
              maxLength: 512
              example: "Suspend this zone. No longer active."
