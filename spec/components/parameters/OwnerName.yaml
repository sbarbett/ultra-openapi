  The owner name of the RRSet. Can be either:
  
  - **Relative Domain Name**: Does not include the zone name (e.g., `test`, `www`, `mail`)
  - **Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)**: Includes the zone name (e.g., `test.domain.com.`, `www.domain.com.`)
  
  **Important Notes:**
  
  - When the owner name is specified as part of the URI, the search will return only the RRSets for the owner name that exactly matches the specified name
  - Using a query parameter with an owner name is automatically a string-match search; it will return all owner names that contain the specified string
  - Owner names ending with a dot (.) are considered FQDNs
  - Owner names without a trailing dot are considered relative to the zone
  
  **Examples:**
  - `test` - Relative name (will match `test.domain.com.`)
  - `test.domain.com.` - FQDN (absolute name)
  - `www` - Relative name (will match `www.domain.com.`)
  - `mail.domain.com.` - FQDN (absolute name)
example: "test"
