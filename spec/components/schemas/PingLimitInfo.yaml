  Limit configuration for PING probe transactions. Defines thresholds for packet loss,
  timing limits, and their averages.
  
  All timing values are in seconds. Some limits are only applicable to Traffic Controller pools.
properties:
  lossPercent:
    type: object
    description: |
      Packet loss percentage thresholds. Values represent the percentage of packets
      lost that would trigger the event.
      
      For example, 5 means packet loss > 5% triggers the event.
      0 always fails the probe; 100 ensures the probe succeeds.
