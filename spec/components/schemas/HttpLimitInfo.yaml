  Limit configuration for HTTP probe transactions. Defines timing thresholds for
  connect time, run time, and their averages, as well as response validation
  criteria.
  
  All timing values are in seconds. Some limits are only applicable to Traffic Controller pools.

  searchString:
    type: object
    description: |
      String or regex pattern to search for in the HTTP response body.
      
      If left blank, the HTTP probe verifies that the server responds with a
      successful HTTP response (normally Status Code 200).
      
      If specified, the probe searches the response's body only; it does not
      search the status line and headers. If the probe does not find the string
      within the response, the probe attempts to match it as a regular expression.
    properties:
      warning:
        type: string
        description: String pattern to search for to trigger a warning. Optional, only used for Traffic Controller Pools.
        example: "Powered by"

        description: |
          String pattern to search for to trigger a fail.
          
          Optional. If specified, probe searches response body; otherwise verifies
          successful HTTP response.
