  Probe type-specific details. The structure varies based on the probe type:
  
  - **HTTP**: Multiple transactions with HTTP methods, URLs, and response validation
  - **PING**: ICMP packet configuration with packet count, size, and timing limits
  - **FTP**: FTP connection with port, passive mode, authentication, and path validation
  - **TCP**: TCP connection with port and optional control IP
  - **SMTP**: SMTP connection with port and timing limits
  - **SMTP_SEND**: SMTP email send with port, from/to addresses, message, and timing limits
  - **DNS**: DNS query with port, TCP/UDP protocol, record type, owner name, and response validation
  
  This is a polymorphic schema where the actual fields depend on the probe `type`
  specified in the parent `ProbeInfo` object.
